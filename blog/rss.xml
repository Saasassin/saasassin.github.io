Similar tools do exist, but they seem to focus on vanity metrics, random charts without a purpose, and all share the same trait in that they're horribly expensive for the typical SMB shop to justify. </p><p><strong>What's more amazing is that the team has designed NitroIQ to run entirely in the browser.</strong> </p><p>So... <strong>our hosting costs ar near-zero and no data leaves your JIRA instance!</strong></p><ul><li>Cheap? âœ…</li><li>Secure? âœ…</li><li>Profit! ðŸ’²</li></ul><p>Meanwhile the few competitors that exist have taken on millions in funding, price their product outside of the reach of most companies, and require consultants and training to get up and running. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-steps">Next Steps<a href="#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next Steps" title="Direct link to Next Steps">â€‹</a></h2><p>We're on track for publishing NitroIQ to the Atlassian Marketplace within a month. Current plan is to make it available as a 30-day free trial to all that sign up. <em>Hopefully I don't regret writing this part on this blog post and we stay on track for that.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
