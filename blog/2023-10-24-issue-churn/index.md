## What is Issue Churn?

In the context of Agile software development, issue churn is a metric that can be used to measure the efficiency of a team.

**Issue churn is a term used to describe the amount (issues or points) that have rolled over from one sprint to the next.**

It is a measure of the amount of work that has **not** been completed in a given sprint. The _higher_ the churn count, the _less_ efficient the team is.

It's also important to represent Issue Churn as a Rate... that is, the amount of stories that are rolled over from one sprint to the next compared to the total number of stories that were planned for the sprint. _This is a more accurate representation of the team's efficiency._

**Some Issue Churn is Ok**

It's important to note that some issue churn is ok. In fact, it's expected. The goal is to minimize churn as much as possible, but it's not always possible to eliminate it completely.

## The Causes of Churn

Churn is caused by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to poor:

- Planning
- Communication
- Estimation
- Prioritization
- Execution

Exact causes of churn will vary from team to team, and almost always have a large human and communication component. From our own experiences in helping teams diagnose churn issues, we have found that the most effective way to address churn is to have open discussions between engineering and product. This allows both teams to understand the root cause of churn and work together to address it.

## Steps to Reduce Churn (or why you clicked into this article...)

Many, if not all, of these factors are interrelated. For example, poor planning can lead to poor communication, which can lead to poor estimation, which can lead to poor prioritization, which can lead to poor execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly as a team (engineering and product).

Reducing churn is a team effort and requires a combination of planning, communication, estimation, prioritization, and execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly. There is no silver bullet for reducing churn, but there are some best practices that can help. Here are some tips for reducing churn:

- **Plan Ahead**: Planning ahead can help reduce churn by ensuring that all team members are on the same page and have a clear understanding of what needs to be done. This can be done by creating a backlog of work and prioritizing it based on importance and urgency. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

- **Communicate Effectively**: Effective communication is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by having regular meetings with stakeholders and team members to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

- **Estimate Accurately**: Accurate estimation is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by using historical data to estimate how long it will take to complete a task and then adding a buffer for unexpected delays. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

- **Prioritize Work**: Prioritizing work is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by creating a backlog of work and prioritizing it based on importance and urgency. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

- **Execute Efficiently**: Efficient execution is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by using tools like NitroIQ to identify issues that are causing churn and then taking action to address them. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

- **Improve Processes**: Improving processes is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by identifying areas for improvement and then taking action to address them. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

- **Improve Team Morale**: Improving team morale is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by recognizing team members for their hard work and providing them with opportunities to grow and develop. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.

## Conclusion

Churn can be simple to measure but difficult to address in Agile shops. It requires a team effort and a combination of planning, communication, estimation, prioritization, and execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly. There is no silver bullet for reducing churn, but there are some best practices that can help.

_I recently wrote a documentation article on [Diagnosing Issue Churn](https://nitroiq.io/docs/how_to/diagnosing_issue_churn/) for those using NitroIQ to better their Agile practice._
