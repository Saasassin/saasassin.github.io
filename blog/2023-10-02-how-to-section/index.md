## New Docs How-To Section

We recently added a new section to our online documentation called [How-To](https://docs.nitroiq.io/how_to/). This section is designed to help you get the most out of NitroIQ by providing you with step-by-step instructions on how to use NitroIQ to diagnose and address common problems in Jira and developer performance.

The How-To section is broken down into distinct categories that mirror the functionality in the application. For example, if you are having issues with issue churn, you can navigate to the [Diagnosing Issue Churn](https://docs.nitroiq.io/how_to/diagnosing_issue_churn/) page to learn how to use NitroIQ to diagnose and address issue churn. \

Future plans are to have these How-To articles linked directly from the application itself, so that you can quickly access them when you need them in the context of the application page you are on.
