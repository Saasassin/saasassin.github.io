The _higher_ the churn count, the _less_ efficient the team is.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to represent Issue Churn as a Rate... that is, the amount of stories that are rolled over from one sprint to the next compared to the total number of stories that were planned for the sprint. _This is a more accurate representation of the team\'s efficiency._\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={Churn2} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nI recently wrote a documentation article on [Diagnosing Issue Churn](https://nitroiq.io/docs/how_to/diagnosing_issue_churn/) for those using NitroIQ.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Causes of Churn\\n\\nChurn is caused by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to poor:\\n\\n- Planning\\n- Communication\\n- Estimation\\n- Prioritization\\n- Execution\\n\\nExact causes of churn will vary from team to team, and almost always have a large human and communication component. From our own experiences in helping teams diagnose churn issues, we have found that the most effective way to address churn is to have open discussions between engineering and product. This allows both teams to understand the root cause of churn and work together to address it.\\n\\n## Steps to Reduce Churn (or why you clicked into this article...)\\n\\nMany, if not all, of these factors are interrelated. For example, poor planning can lead to poor communication, which can lead to poor estimation, which can lead to poor prioritization, which can lead to poor execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly as a team (engineering and product).\\n\\nReducing churn is a team effort and requires a combination of planning, communication, estimation, prioritization, and execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly. There is no silver bullet for reducing churn, but there are some best practices that can help. Here are some tips for reducing churn:\\n\\n- **Plan Ahead**: Planning ahead can help reduce churn by ensuring that all team members are on the same page and have a clear understanding of what needs to be done. This can be done by creating a backlog of work and prioritizing it based on importance and urgency. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Communicate Effectively**: Effective communication is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by having regular meetings with stakeholders and team members to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Estimate Accurately**: Accurate estimation is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by using historical data to estimate how long it will take to complete a task and then adding a buffer for unexpected delays. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Prioritize Work**: Prioritizing work is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by creating a backlog of work and prioritizing it based on importance and urgency. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Execute Efficiently**: Efficient execution is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by using tools like NitroIQ to identify issues that are causing churn and then taking action to address them. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Improve Processes**: Improving processes is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by identifying areas for improvement and then taking action to address them. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Improve Team Morale**: Improving team morale is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by recognizing team members for their hard work and providing them with opportunities to grow and develop. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nChurn can be simple to measure but difficult to address in Agile shops. It requires a team effort and a combination of planning, communication, estimation, prioritization, and execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly. There is no silver bullet for reducing churn, but there are some best practices that can help."},{"id":"how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-02-how-to-section/index.md","title":"How to Diagnose Problems in JIRA","description":"How to use NitroIQ to diagnose problems in JIRA","date":"2023-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 2, 2023","tags":[{"label":"nitroiq","permalink":"/blog/tags/nitroiq"},{"label":"jira","permalink":"/blog/tags/jira"},{"label":"issue churn","permalink":"/blog/tags/issue-churn"},{"label":"backlog maintenance","permalink":"/blog/tags/backlog-maintenance"},{"label":"how-to","permalink":"/blog/tags/how-to"}],"readingTime":0.67,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Russo","title":"Imperator Caesar","url":"https://www.royrusso.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/royrusso.png","key":"royrusso"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to Diagnose Problems in JIRA","description":"How to use NitroIQ to diagnose problems in JIRA","slug":"how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira","authors":"royrusso","tags":["nitroiq","jira","issue churn","backlog maintenance","how-to"],"image":"https://nitroiq.io/img/nitroiq_logo_w_bg.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"On Issue Churn in Agile shops","permalink":"/blog/address-issue-churn-in-agile"},"nextItem":{"title":"Live on the Atlassian Marketplace","permalink":"/blog/nitroiq-atlassian-marketplace"}},"content":"## New Docs How-To Section\\n\\nWe recently added a new section to our online documentation called [How-To](https://nitroiq.io/docs/category/how-to/).

After leaving my last job, I finally had the opportunity to work on a tool that would unlock the data hidden behind the JIRA scrum boards. Managing teams at scale and trying to find out where the bottlenecks are, which sprints perform better than others (and why), and which team members perform better than others (and why) is a difficult prospect in JIRA, and the included reporting doesn\'t help at all in this regard.\\n\\n## Why NitroIQ?\\n\\nJIRA data is locked behind a lot of API calls and individual issue changelogs. I needed a way to parse all of this data and distill it down in simple to use charts and tables that answered those pressing questions that allowed me to unblock and tune my teams and processes for maximum efficiency.\\n\\nSo what questions is NitroIQ seeking to answer?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={Sankey} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n- Where are my bottlenecks in process, statuses, teams, etc...?\\n- Are issue bouncing back-and-forth between statuses and teams?\\n- Are we spending most of our time as a company working on bugs and not innovating?\\n- What percentage of issues is rolling over sprint-over-sprint?\\n- What is the state of the backlog? Issue age and readiness to work on.\\n- Which team members are performing the most consistently sprint-over-sprint?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Reception so Far\\n\\nMore important than what they\'re saying, is what they\'re **doing** with the app!\\n\\nOur team has witnessed teams change their behavior in several ways, from heavily pruning/adressing backlog items that are > 120 days old or issues that score badly with our algorithms, to engineering leads using the data we expose to have honest conversations on performance with team members and conversations with the business on engineering throughput and technical debt.\\n\\nWhen I sit by CTOs and Product Managers using the application, I hear two things:\\n\\n1. \\"This explains what I\'ve been seeing\\", and\\n2. \\"Wait.

Answer basic questions that engineering leaders and teams need to know about their performance sprint-over-sprint.\\n2. Using machine learning and decades of combined experience, **recommend ways to improve processes**.\\n\\n## NitroIQ is in Private Beta\\n\\nWe\'ve had NitroIQ installed with friendly software organizations for a few months now, and the feedback has helped a lot in mapping out our next steps. \\n\\nBeing in private beta has fed the team important information, we would not have otherwise had, such as:\\n\\n- Product-Market fit. *Is this useful?*\\n- Price sensitivity. *What is this worth to you?*\\n- Roadmap feedback. *What would you like to see in the next version?*\\n\\nAdditionally, every shop seems to configure JIRA differently, so building a tool that seemlessly plugs into an existing configuration and **does not require changes in JIRA** was nice to have pulled off.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## But Really, what are people saying?\\n\\nMore important than what they\'re saying, is what they\'re **doing** with the app!\\n\\nOur team has witnessed teams change their behavior in several ways, from heavily pruning/adressing backlog items that are > 120 days old or issues that score badly with our algorithms, to engineering leads using the data we expose to have honest conversations on performance with team members and conversations with the business on engineering throughput and technical debt.\\n\\nNo one wants a high *Doom Score*, right?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={BacklogScore} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Why NitroIQ?\\n\\nIt is a tool that I\'ve always wanted in my hands as I built high-performing teams in an Agile shop. Similar tools do exist, but they seem to focus on vanity metrics, random charts without a purpose, and all share the same trait in that they\'re horribly expensive for the typical SMB shop to justify. \\n\\n**What\'s more amazing is that the team has designed NitroIQ to run entirely in the browser.** \\n\\nSo... **our hosting costs ar near-zero and no data leaves your JIRA instance!**\\n\\n- Cheap? :white_check_mark:\\n- Secure? :white_check_mark:\\n- Profit! :heavy_dollar_sign:\\n\\nMeanwhile the few competitors that exist have taken on millions in funding, price their product outside of the reach of most companies, and require consultants and training to get up and running. \\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWe\'re on track for publishing NitroIQ to the Atlassian Marketplace within a month. Current plan is to make it available as a 30-day free trial to all that sign up. *Hopefully I don\'t regret writing this part on this blog post and we stay on track for that.*"}]}')}}]);
