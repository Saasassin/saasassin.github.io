I\'ve often witnessed in my career that diagnosing a team\'s (product + engineering) inability to deliver on time, requires me to look at the backlog **first**!\\n\\nThe purpose of regularly maintaining (or grooming) a backlog is to ensure that the backlog is always up-to-date and that the team is always working on the most important issues. This is especially important for teams that are working on multiple projects at once, as it can be difficult to keep track of all the issues that need to be addressed.\\n\\nFailure to maintain a backlog is a common occurence I\'ve witnessed in my career and the effects can manifest in a variety of ways. However, the most common effects are:\\n\\n- The team is working on issues that are not the most important (lack of prioritization)\\n- Product Management is unable to provide accurate estimates on when a feature will be delivered (lack of estimation) to customers and management.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## 5 Tips to a Healthy Backlog\\n\\n1. **Keep your backlog CURRENT and RELEVANT** - The backlog should be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project. This includes adding new issues, removing completed issues, and updating the status of existing issues. **This also means regularly pruning OLD issues**. For example: if an issue has been sitting in the backlog for more than 3 months, it\'s likely that it\'s no longer relevant. If it is, it should be re-prioritized and re-estimated. (3 months is a good rule of thumb, but it depends on your team\'s velocity).\\n\\n2. **Backlog Issues should be ordered by priority** - The backlog should be ordered by priority, with the most important issues at the top. This allows the team to focus on the most important issues first, and ensures that they are always working on the most important issues. This also helps Product Management to provide accurate estimates on when a feature will be delivered to customers and management.\\n\\n3. **Estimate your Issues** - This tip may depend on your existing product management workflows regarding how issues arrive at the backlog, but as a general rule, I recommend people keep backlog items estimated. Estimaes will help guide the team on ranking priority and will help provide better accuracy on delivery dates and resouce allocation.\\n\\n4. **Backlog Issues should have a clear Definition of Done** - Garbage belongs in the bin, not the backlog. If issues are arriving in the backlog without a clear definition of Done or Acceptance Criteria that everyone understands, then they should be rejected.\\n\\n5. **Categorize and Tag your Issues** - Tags and Labels should be used to help categorize or group issues together. This will help Product Management and Engineering to quickly filter and find issues that are related. Categorized issue, for instance, can help with prioritization as engineers can knock-out multiple issues that are related, and in the same part of the codebase, at the same time.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nMaintaining your backlog is an important ritual step in the Agile process. Backlogs act as a living queue of work that the business has prioritized for the team to work on. Without proper grooming, the backlog can become stale and lose its value, leading to a variety of negative issues.\\n\\nFor those of you using NitroIQ, we\'ve made it easy to maintain your backlog with our ability to auto-score your backlog, highlight issues that require further refinement and are \\"too old\\", and increased visibility into your backlog health with our [Backlog Doom Score](https://nitroiq.io/docs/metrics/understanding-doom-score/)."},{"id":"address-issue-churn-in-agile","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/address-issue-churn-in-agile","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-24-issue-churn/index.md","title":"On Issue Churn in Agile shops","description":"The Importance of Addressing Issue Churn in the SDLC","date":"2023-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 24, 2023","tags":[{"label":"jira","permalink":"/blog/tags/jira"},{"label":"issue churn","permalink":"/blog/tags/issue-churn"},{"label":"agile","permalink":"/blog/tags/agile"},{"label":"how-to","permalink":"/blog/tags/how-to"}],"readingTime":4.25,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Russo","title":"Imperator Caesar","url":"https://www.royrusso.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/royrusso.png","key":"royrusso"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"On Issue Churn in Agile shops","description":"The Importance of Addressing Issue Churn in the SDLC","slug":"address-issue-churn-in-agile","authors":"royrusso","tags":["jira","issue churn","agile","how-to"],"image":"https://nitroiq.io/img/nitroiq_logo_w_bg.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Maintaining your Backlog","permalink":"/blog/maintaining-your-backlog"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Diagnose Problems in JIRA","permalink":"/blog/how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira"}},"content":"import Churn1 from \'./jira_issue_churn1.png\';\\nimport Churn2 from \'./jira_issue_churn2.png\';\\n\\n## What is Issue Churn?\\n\\nIn the context of Agile software development, issue churn is a metric that can be used to measure the efficiency of a team.\\n\\n**Issue churn is a term used to describe the amount (issues or points) that have rolled over from one sprint to the next.**\\n\\nIt is a measure of the amount of work that has **not** been completed in a given sprint. The _higher_ the churn count, the _less_ efficient the team is.\\n\\nIt\'s also important to represent Issue Churn as a Rate... that is, the amount of stories that are rolled over from one sprint to the next compared to the total number of stories that were planned for the sprint. _This is a more accurate representation of the team\'s efficiency._\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={Churn2} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\n**Some Issue Churn is Ok**\\n\\nIt\'s important to note that some issue churn is ok. In fact, it\'s expected. The goal is to minimize churn as much as possible, but it\'s not always possible to eliminate it completely.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Causes of Churn\\n\\nChurn is caused by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to poor:\\n\\n- Planning\\n- Communication\\n- Estimation\\n- Prioritization\\n- Execution\\n\\nExact causes of churn will vary from team to team, and almost always have a large human and communication component. From our own experiences in helping teams diagnose churn issues, we have found that the most effective way to address churn is to have open discussions between engineering and product. This allows both teams to understand the root cause of churn and work together to address it.\\n\\n## Steps to Reduce Churn (or why you clicked into this article...)\\n\\nMany, if not all, of these factors are interrelated. For example, poor planning can lead to poor communication, which can lead to poor estimation, which can lead to poor prioritization, which can lead to poor execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly as a team (engineering and product).\\n\\nReducing churn is a team effort and requires a combination of planning, communication, estimation, prioritization, and execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly. There is no silver bullet for reducing churn, but there are some best practices that can help. Here are some tips for reducing churn:\\n\\n- **Plan Ahead**: Planning ahead can help reduce churn by ensuring that all team members are on the same page and have a clear understanding of what needs to be done. This can be done by creating a backlog of work and prioritizing it based on importance and urgency. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Communicate Effectively**: Effective communication is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by having regular meetings with stakeholders and team members to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Estimate Accurately**: Accurate estimation is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by using historical data to estimate how long it will take to complete a task and then adding a buffer for unexpected delays. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Prioritize Work**: Prioritizing work is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by creating a backlog of work and prioritizing it based on importance and urgency. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Execute Efficiently**: Efficient execution is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by using tools like NitroIQ to identify issues that are causing churn and then taking action to address them. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Improve Processes**: Improving processes is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by identifying areas for improvement and then taking action to address them. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n- **Improve Team Morale**: Improving team morale is essential for reducing churn. This can be done by recognizing team members for their hard work and providing them with opportunities to grow and develop. It is also important to communicate with stakeholders and get their input on what needs to be done.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nChurn can be simple to measure but difficult to address in Agile shops. It requires a team effort and a combination of planning, communication, estimation, prioritization, and execution. The key is to identify the root cause of churn and address it accordingly. There is no silver bullet for reducing churn, but there are some best practices that can help.\\n\\n_I recently wrote a documentation article on [Diagnosing Issue Churn](https://nitroiq.io/docs/how_to/diagnosing_issue_churn/) for those using NitroIQ to better their Agile practice._"},{"id":"how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-02-how-to-section/index.md","title":"How to Diagnose Problems in JIRA","description":"How to use NitroIQ to diagnose problems in JIRA","date":"2023-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 2, 2023","tags":[{"label":"nitroiq","permalink":"/blog/tags/nitroiq"},{"label":"jira","permalink":"/blog/tags/jira"},{"label":"issue churn","permalink":"/blog/tags/issue-churn"},{"label":"backlog maintenance","permalink":"/blog/tags/backlog-maintenance"},{"label":"how-to","permalink":"/blog/tags/how-to"}],"readingTime":0.67,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Russo","title":"Imperator Caesar","url":"https://www.royrusso.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/royrusso.png","key":"royrusso"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to Diagnose Problems in JIRA","description":"How to use NitroIQ to diagnose problems in JIRA","slug":"how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira","authors":"royrusso","tags":["nitroiq","jira","issue churn","backlog maintenance","how-to"],"image":"https://nitroiq.io/img/nitroiq_logo_w_bg.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"On Issue Churn in Agile shops","permalink":"/blog/address-issue-churn-in-agile"},"nextItem":{"title":"Live on the Atlassian Marketplace","permalink":"/blog/nitroiq-atlassian-marketplace"}},"content":"## New Docs How-To Section\\n\\nWe recently added a new section to our online documentation called [How-To](https://nitroiq.io/docs/category/how-to/).

After leaving my last job, I finally had the opportunity to work on a tool that would unlock the data hidden behind the JIRA scrum boards. Managing teams at scale and trying to find out where the bottlenecks are, which sprints perform better than others (and why), and which team members perform better than others (and why) is a difficult prospect in JIRA, and the included reporting doesn\'t help at all in this regard.\\n\\n## Why NitroIQ?\\n\\nJIRA data is locked behind a lot of API calls and individual issue changelogs. I needed a way to parse all of this data and distill it down in simple to use charts and tables that answered those pressing questions that allowed me to unblock and tune my teams and processes for maximum efficiency.\\n\\nSo what questions is NitroIQ seeking to answer?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={Sankey} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n- Where are my bottlenecks in process, statuses, teams, etc...?\\n- Are issue bouncing back-and-forth between statuses and teams?\\n- Are we spending most of our time as a company working on bugs and not innovating?\\n- What percentage of issues is rolling over sprint-over-sprint?\\n- What is the state of the backlog?

Similar tools do exist, but they seem to focus on vanity metrics, random charts without a purpose, and all share the same trait in that they\'re horribly expensive for the typical SMB shop to justify. \\n\\n**What\'s more amazing is that the team has designed NitroIQ to run entirely in the browser.** \\n\\nSo... **our hosting costs ar near-zero and no data leaves your JIRA instance!**\\n\\n- Cheap? :white_check_mark:\\n- Secure? :white_check_mark:\\n- Profit! :heavy_dollar_sign:\\n\\nMeanwhile the few competitors that exist have taken on millions in funding, price their product outside of the reach of most companies, and require consultants and training to get up and running. \\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWe\'re on track for publishing NitroIQ to the Atlassian Marketplace within a month. Current plan is to make it available as a 30-day free trial to all that sign up. *Hopefully I don\'t regret writing this part on this blog post and we stay on track for that.*"}]}')}}]);
