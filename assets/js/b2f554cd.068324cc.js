For example, if you are having issues with issue churn, you can navigate to the [Diagnosing Issue Churn](https://docs.nitroiq.io/how_to/diagnosing_issue_churn/) page to learn how to use NitroIQ to diagnose and address issue churn.\\n\\nFuture plans are to have these How-To articles linked directly from the application itself, so that you can quickly access them when you need them in the context of the application page you are on."},{"id":"nitroiq-atlassian-marketplace","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/nitroiq-atlassian-marketplace","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-26-public-beta/index.md","title":"Live on the Atlassian Marketplace","description":"Launching NitroIQ on the Atlassian Marketplace","date":"2023-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"nitroiq","permalink":"/blog/tags/nitroiq"},{"label":"jira","permalink":"/blog/tags/jira"}],"readingTime":2.44,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Roy Russo","title":"Imperator Caesar","url":"https://www.royrusso.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/royrusso.png","key":"royrusso"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Live on the Atlassian Marketplace","description":"Launching NitroIQ on the Atlassian Marketplace","slug":"nitroiq-atlassian-marketplace","authors":"royrusso","tags":["nitroiq","jira"],"image":"https://nitroiq.io/img/atlassian_marketplace.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Diagnose Problems in JIRA","permalink":"/blog/how-to-diagnose-problems-in-jira"},"nextItem":{"title":"NitroIQ - Private Beta","permalink":"/blog/nitroiq-private-beta"}},"content":"import IntroVideo from \'./intro.gif\';\\nimport Sankey from \'./jira_board_column_flow.png\';\\nimport MarketPlace from \'./atlassian_marketplace.png\';\\n\\n## Live on the Atlassian Marketplace\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1232080?tab=overview&hosting=cloud\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src={MarketPlace} className=\\"doc_image\\"/></a>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1232080?tab=overview&hosting=cloud\\">NitroIQ Marketplace Page ></a>\\n</p>\\n\\nAfter several months of work, NitroIQ is generally available to the public on the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1232080?tab=overview&hosting=cloud). _(Visit the page for a gallery of images and a short video)_\\n\\nNitroIQ is the JIRA plugin I always wanted and never had the time to build. After leaving my last job, I finally had the opportunity to work on a tool that would unlock the data hidden behind the JIRA scrum boards. Managing teams at scale and trying to find out where the bottlenecks are, which sprints perform better than others (and why), and which team members perform better than others (and why) is a difficult prospect in JIRA, and the included reporting doesn\'t help at all in this regard.\\n\\n## Why NitroIQ?\\n\\nJIRA data is locked behind a lot of API calls and individual issue changelogs. I needed a way to parse all of this data and distill it down in simple to use charts and tables that answered those pressing questions that allowed me to unblock and tune my teams and processes for maximum efficiency.\\n\\nSo what questions is NitroIQ seeking to answer?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={Sankey} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n- Where are my bottlenecks in process, statuses, teams, etc...?\\n- Are issue bouncing back-and-forth between statuses and teams?\\n- Are we spending most of our time as a company working on bugs and not innovating?\\n- What percentage of issues is rolling over sprint-over-sprint?\\n- What is the state of the backlog? Issue age and readiness to work on.\\n- Which team members are performing the most consistently sprint-over-sprint?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Reception so Far\\n\\nMore important than what they\'re saying, is what they\'re **doing** with the app!\\n\\nOur team has witnessed teams change their behavior in several ways, from heavily pruning/adressing backlog items that are > 120 days old or issues that score badly with our algorithms, to engineering leads using the data we expose to have honest conversations on performance with team members and conversations with the business on engineering throughput and technical debt.\\n\\nWhen I sit by CTOs and Product Managers using the application, I hear two things:\\n\\n1. \\"This explains what I\'ve been seeing\\", and\\n2. \\"Wait.

Answer basic questions that engineering leaders and teams need to know about their performance sprint-over-sprint.\\n2. Using machine learning and decades of combined experience, **recommend ways to improve processes**.\\n\\n## NitroIQ is in Private Beta\\n\\nWe\'ve had NitroIQ installed with friendly software organizations for a few months now, and the feedback has helped a lot in mapping out our next steps. \\n\\nBeing in private beta has fed the team important information, we would not have otherwise had, such as:\\n\\n- Product-Market fit. *Is this useful?*\\n- Price sensitivity. *What is this worth to you?*\\n- Roadmap feedback. *What would you like to see in the next version?*\\n\\nAdditionally, every shop seems to configure JIRA differently, so building a tool that seemlessly plugs into an existing configuration and **does not require changes in JIRA** was nice to have pulled off.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## But Really, what are people saying?\\n\\nMore important than what they\'re saying, is what they\'re **doing** with the app!\\n\\nOur team has witnessed teams change their behavior in several ways, from heavily pruning/adressing backlog items that are > 120 days old or issues that score badly with our algorithms, to engineering leads using the data we expose to have honest conversations on performance with team members and conversations with the business on engineering throughput and technical debt.\\n\\nNo one wants a high *Doom Score*, right?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src={BacklogScore} className=\\"doc_image\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Why NitroIQ?\\n\\nIt is a tool that I\'ve always wanted in my hands as I built high-performing teams in an Agile shop. Similar tools do exist, but they seem to focus on vanity metrics, random charts without a purpose, and all share the same trait in that they\'re horribly expensive for the typical SMB shop to justify. \\n\\n**What\'s more amazing is that the team has designed NitroIQ to run entirely in the browser.** \\n\\nSo... **our hosting costs ar near-zero and no data leaves your JIRA instance!**\\n\\n- Cheap? :white_check_mark:\\n- Secure? :white_check_mark:\\n- Profit! :heavy_dollar_sign:\\n\\nMeanwhile the few competitors that exist have taken on millions in funding, price their product outside of the reach of most companies, and require consultants and training to get up and running. \\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWe\'re on track for publishing NitroIQ to the Atlassian Marketplace within a month. Current plan is to make it available as a 30-day free trial to all that sign up. *Hopefully I don\'t regret writing this part on this blog post and we stay on track for that.*"}]}')}}]);
