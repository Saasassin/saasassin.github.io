Customer acquires no ownership rights in or title to the Hosted Services and will not at any time have physical access to any facility providing the Hosted Services. Except for the license rights expressly granted to Customer in Section 1.1, and except as provided in Section 1.7, Saasassin and its licensors (if any) retain all ownership rights in and title to the Hosted Services.</p><p>1.7
The Hosted Services may include certain open-source software and other freely available software and material (&quot;Excluded Components&quot;). Saasassin will identify Excluded Components included in the Hosted Services upon request for a proper purpose consistent with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Excluded Components are governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable license and/or notice provided by the third party authors, contributors and suppliers of the Excluded Components (the “Suppliers”), and Saasassin has no responsibility or liability of any kind related to such Excluded Components. The Suppliers&#x27; licenses and other notices (including instructions for obtaining source code for certain Excluded Components), may be available in the documentation accompanying the Hosted Services. Customer agrees to comply with all such licenses and other notices. Further, and notwithstanding any of the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement Customer may have with Saasassin:</p><p>(a) the Suppliers provide the Excluded Components WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND SUCH SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXCLUDED COMPONENTS; and</p><p>(b) in no event are the Suppliers liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, including, but not limited to lost data, lost savings and lost profits, with respect to the Excluded Components.</p><p>1.8.

Customer may terminate use of the Hosted Services at any time for any reason or no reason by ceasing to use the Hosted Services.</p><p>2.3
Saasassin may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Customer if Customer breaches a material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days following such notice. Notwithstanding the above, Saasassin may terminate this Agreement immediately after providing written notice to Customer if Customer Saasassin an un-curable provision of this Agreement such as, but not limited to, the provisions regarding reverse engineering, disassembly, decompilation or confidentiality.</p><p>2.4
Upon termination of this Agreement, (a) Customer will immediately cease all use of the Hosted Services; and (b) Saasassin will delete any confidential information of Customer then on Saasassin’s servers; provided that, if termination occurs for any reason other than Customer’s breach, Saasassin may retain such information subject to Saasassin and Customer agreeing separately on the terms under which Saasassin would retain such information. Termination of this Agreement will not prevent either party from pursuing all available legal remedies that accrued prior to termination, nor will it relieve Customer of any obligation to make payments that accrued prior to termination. The parties&#x27; rights and obligations under Sections 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.10, 2.4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.</p><p>2.5<br>
<!-- -->In addition to Saasassin’s rights to terminate this Agreement, Saasassin may suspend Customer’s right to access the Hosted Services at any time if Saasassin determines, in its sole discretion, that Customer’s use of the Hosted Services is interrupting or interfering with the normal operation of the Hosted Services.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-payments">3.

In addition, during the term of this Agreement Saasassin may also disclose to Customer certain other Confidential Information. Customer will hold Saasassin’s Confidential Information in confidence and will use its best efforts to protect it. Customer will use such Confidential Information for the sole purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement. Customer will not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than, in the case of a Customer that is an entity, employees and independent contractors of Customer who need to know such Confidential Information in order to carry out the terms of this Agreement and who are bound by a written confidentiality agreement with Customer that is no less protective of such Confidential Information than this Agreement. Upon request of Saasassin, Customer will provide Saasassin with reasonable evidence of such written confidentiality agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer will either return to Saasassin all Confidential Information in its possession (including all copies) or will, at Saasassin’s direction, destroy all Confidential Information (including all copies) and Customer (or in the case of a Customer that is an entity, an officer of Customer) will certify its destruction to Saasassin. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality and non-use will not apply to any Confidential Information that Customer can show, by competent evidence: (a) is publicly known at the time of disclosure or enters the public domain following disclosure through no fault of Customer; or (b) Customer can demonstrate was already in its possession without restriction prior to disclosure under this Agreement. Customer may disclose Confidential Information upon the order of any competent court or government agency, provided that, prior to such disclosure Customer will, unless prohibited by law, inform Saasassin of such order and provide Saasassin with reasonable assistance to prevent or limit such disclosure. Customer agrees that its obligations under this Article are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Saasassin and its business, and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Saasassin for any breach by Customer of such obligations. Accordingly, Customer agrees and acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Saasassin and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise, Saasassin will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the continued breach or threatened breach of Customer&#x27;s obligations under this Section 5 without the necessity of proving actual damages.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-customer-representations-and-warranties">6.
