1.7
The Hosted Services may include certain open-source software and other freely available software and material ("Excluded Components").

1.10. Neither party will take any action intended to appropriate or perfect rights in the intellectual property of the other, including, without limitation, the filing of patent, trademark, or service mark applications or copyright registrations.

## 2. Term and Termination

2.1
This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue until the earlier of (a) termination pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (b) Saasassin and Customer entering into a further agreement that expressly supersedes this Agreement.

2.2
Customer may terminate use of the Hosted Services at any time for any reason or no reason by ceasing to use the Hosted Services.

2.3
Saasassin may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Customer if Customer breaches a material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days following such notice. Notwithstanding the above, Saasassin may terminate this Agreement immediately after providing written notice to Customer if Customer Saasassin an un-curable provision of this Agreement such as, but not limited to, the provisions regarding reverse engineering, disassembly, decompilation or confidentiality.

2.4
Upon termination of this Agreement, (a) Customer will immediately cease all use of the Hosted Services; and (b) Saasassin will delete any confidential information of Customer then on Saasassin’s servers; provided that, if termination occurs for any reason other than Customer’s breach, Saasassin may retain such information subject to Saasassin and Customer agreeing separately on the terms under which Saasassin would retain such information. Termination of this Agreement will not prevent either party from pursuing all available legal remedies that accrued prior to termination, nor will it relieve Customer of any obligation to make payments that accrued prior to termination. The parties' rights and obligations under Sections 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.10, 2.4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.

2.5  
In addition to Saasassin’s rights to terminate this Agreement, Saasassin may suspend Customer’s right to access the Hosted Services at any time if Saasassin determines, in its sole discretion, that Customer’s use of the Hosted Services is interrupting or interfering with the normal operation of the Hosted Services.

## 3. Payments

Customer agrees to pay Saasassin all amounts required to be paid (a) upon placing an electronic order for a license, or (b) under the terms of any signed agreement between Customer and Saasassin governing Customer's use of the Hosted Services. No failure by Saasassin to request any payment or to demand any performance will be deemed a waiver by Saasassin or a waiver of Saasassin’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

## 4. Equipment

Customer shall, at its own cost and expense, provide all equipment, operating systems, and software (including Web browser) needed to use and access the Hosted Services in accordance with the technical requirements in Saasassin’s documentation. Customer shall also provide, at its own cost and expense, all connections from its computer systems to the Hosted Services.

## 5. Confidentiality

The Hosted Services contain certain information that Saasassin considers either proprietary, confidential, or both (collectively, "Confidential Information"). In addition, during the term of this Agreement Saasassin may also disclose to Customer certain other Confidential Information. Customer will hold Saasassin’s Confidential Information in confidence and will use its best efforts to protect it. Customer will use such Confidential Information for the sole purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement. Customer will not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than, in the case of a Customer that is an entity, employees and independent contractors of Customer who need to know such Confidential Information in order to carry out the terms of this Agreement and who are bound by a written confidentiality agreement with Customer that is no less protective of such Confidential Information than this Agreement. Upon request of Saasassin, Customer will provide Saasassin with reasonable evidence of such written confidentiality agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer will either return to Saasassin all Confidential Information in its possession (including all copies) or will, at Saasassin’s direction, destroy all Confidential Information (including all copies) and Customer (or in the case of a Customer that is an entity, an officer of Customer) will certify its destruction to Saasassin. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality and non-use will not apply to any Confidential Information that Customer can show, by competent evidence: (a) is publicly known at the time of disclosure or enters the public domain following disclosure through no fault of Customer; or (b) Customer can demonstrate was already in its possession without restriction prior to disclosure under this Agreement. Customer may disclose Confidential Information upon the order of any competent court or government agency, provided that, prior to such disclosure Customer will, unless prohibited by law, inform Saasassin of such order and provide Saasassin with reasonable assistance to prevent or limit such disclosure. Customer agrees that its obligations under this Article are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Saasassin and its business, and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Saasassin for any breach by Customer of such obligations. Accordingly, Customer agrees and acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Saasassin and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise, Saasassin will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the continued breach or threatened breach of Customer's obligations under this Section 5 without the necessity of proving actual damages.

## 6. Customer Representations and Warranties

Customer represents and warrants to Saasassin that:

6.1
Customer has full personal or corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, and that entering this Agreement violates no contractual right of any third party; and

6.2
this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Customer and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Customer, enforceable against Customer in accordance with its terms.

## 7. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties

Saasassin shall have no obligations under this warranty if the nonconformity is not reported to Saasassin during the Warranty Period. Customer’s sole remedy and Saasassin’s sole obligation with respect to any breach of the foregoing warranty is to use commercially reasonable efforts to repair the Hosted Services. If Saasassin is unable to remedy the nonconformities within a reasonable time, Customer may terminate the license and this Agreement (subject to the survival of the provisions set forth in Section 2.4). Saasassin will not be responsible or liable for any failure to meet the foregoing responsibilities or any other responsibilities in this Agreement caused, in whole or in part, by Customer’s systems or any hardware.
